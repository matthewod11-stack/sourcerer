## Elevator Pitch

Recruiting agencies charge $30-60K per hire and still take months. Sourcerer is an AI-powered talent sourcing agent that does in minutes what a recruiter does in weeks — it has a conversation with a hiring manager to understand the role, then autonomously searches the web, discovers candidates, enriches them with GitHub/Twitter/email signals, scores them with transparent evidence, and delivers structured results ready for outreach. The business model is open-source tool + done-for-you service, and it's already shipped two client engagements.

## Project Overview

Sourcerer is an AI-powered talent sourcing agent packaged as a TypeScript CLI tool. It runs an intelligent intake conversation with a hiring manager, builds a composite talent profile from multiple inputs (company data, team member profiles, competitor research), discovers candidates across the web via Exa, enriches them with GitHub/Twitter/email signals, scores them with full evidence transparency, and pushes structured results into existing workflow tools (Notion, CSV, JSON, Markdown).

The business model is open-source core + done-for-you services. The CLI is operational leverage — the builder (you) runs Sourcerer for clients, charges per engagement, and undercuts agency fees ($30-60K/hire) with tool-powered speed. Two prior client implementations shipped (Lunar Labs, Agoric) using predecessor repos. Sourcerer is the portable, multi-client version of that work.

**Current milestone:** Phase 1 (Foundation) is COMPLETE. Phase 2 is partially complete (2.1–2.3 shipped, 2.4–2.5 remain). The pipeline can discover candidates via Exa, enrich via GitHub, deduplicate via identity resolution, and checkpoint/resume — but no scoring, no intake conversation, and no output adapters beyond stubs.

## Current Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript 5.8 | Strict mode, ESM throughout |
| Monorepo | Turborepo 2.8 | Topological build, task caching |
| Runtime | Node.js ≥22 | ESM, `nodenext` module resolution |
| Package Manager | pnpm 10.32 | Workspace protocol (`workspace:*`) |
| Test Runner | Vitest 3.2 | Per-package configs, **171 tests all passing** |
| Linter | ESLint + Prettier | Dev deps hoisted to root |
| CLI Prompts | @clack/prompts | Interactive onboarding wizard |
| External APIs | Exa (search), GitHub REST API | Adapters wrap each API behind `DataSource` interface |

No database, no frontend, no web server. Sourcerer is a CLI tool that reads `~/.sourcerer/config.yaml`, runs a pipeline, and writes results to disk (JSON/Markdown) or pushes to external services (Notion).

### Build Order

Turbo builds topologically: `core` → `adapters/*`, `intake`, `ai`, `scoring`, `output/*` (parallel) → `cli`

### Data Flow (V1 Target)

```
Intake Conversation → TalentProfile + SearchConfig + SimilaritySeeds
                                         ↓
Discovery: Exa search (tiered queries) + find_similar (from seeds)
                                         ↓
Dedup: IdentityResolver (confidence-based merge → stable canonicalId)
                                         ↓
Enrichment: GitHub (code signals) + X (social signals) + Hunter (email verify)
                                         ↓
Scoring: LLM signal extraction → weighted calculator → narrative generation
                                         ↓
Output: JSON, Markdown, CSV, Notion (push to existing workflow tools)
```

### Key Patterns

- **Evidence grounding**: LLM signals can ONLY reference canonical `EvidenceItem.id` values — no freeform claims
- **`generateEvidenceId()`**: deterministic `ev-XXXXXX` IDs from SHA-256 of adapter+type+source
- **Identity resolution**: `PersonIdentity` with high/medium/low confidence merging. `canonicalId` survives reruns.
- **PII tracking**: per-field `PIIField` with adapter attribution + retention TTL
- **Adapter-keyed data**: `Record<string, X>` (not Map) for JSON serialization compatibility
- **Config**: `~/.sourcerer/config.yaml` with adapter keys, retention TTLs, AI provider selection
- **Pipeline checkpoints**: serialize state to disk after each phase, resume from last completed phase
- **Cost tracking**: `costIncurred` on `SearchPage` and `BatchResult` from day one

## Recent Decisions

1. **adapter-github moved to Phase 2.3** (from Phase 4A) — eliminates forward dependency from intake's `ContentResearch.analyzeProfile()` which needs GitHub data. Validated during roadmap review.

2. **Google Sheets deferred to Phase 7.6** — OAuth complexity (consent screen, token refresh, secure storage) would block Phase 6. CSV + Notion + JSON + Markdown is sufficient for V1.

3. **GitHub is enrichment-only, not discovery** — Exa handles discovery. GitHub enriches candidates who already have a GitHub username/URL. Prevents GitHub's limited search from narrowing the candidate pool.

4. **`AIProvider` and `ContentResearch` as interfaces in core** — enables Phase 3A (intake) and 3B (AI layer) to develop in parallel against shared contracts, then integrate in 3C.

5. **Post-discovery expansion deferred to Phase 7.2** — P0 similarity from success profile seeds (Phase 3) covers the highest-value use case. Post-discovery `find_similar` is opt-in enhancement.

6. **Approach A: Ship the Engine, Sell the Driving** — interleave building with real client engagements starting at Phase 2 completion. Revenue while you build. Each engagement validates the next phase.

7. **`@clack/prompts` for CLI interaction** — chosen over inquirer for cleaner UX and better ESM support.

8. **Adapter-keyed data uses `Record<string, X>`** — not Map, for JSON serialization compatibility. Decided during type design.

## Known Issues & Debt

### Active

- **healthCheck validation deferred in onboarding** — `sourcerer init` validates key format but doesn't call adapter `healthCheck()` yet (adapters need to be instantiated first). Marked as deferred in roadmap task 2.1.
- **No real API integration tests** — all adapter tests use mocked responses. First real-API test is Phase 2.5.
- **Stub packages** — `packages/intake`, `packages/ai`, `packages/scoring`, `packages/output/output-json`, `packages/output/output-markdown` export empty barrel files. They compile and are wired into the workspace but contain no implementation.

### Technical Debt

- No CI/CD pipeline — tests only run locally via `pnpm test`
- No ESLint config yet (Prettier is configured)
- `.js` extension convention in imports (TypeScript ESM requirement) — may confuse contributors unfamiliar with this pattern
- Config stores API keys in plaintext YAML — acceptable for V1 CLI tool, not for a hosted service

## What's Next

### Immediate (next session)

1. **Phase 2.4: output-json + output-markdown** — implement `OutputAdapter` for both. JSON writes `candidates.json` to run directory. Markdown generates formatted report grouped by tier with narrative briefs, score breakdowns, evidence links.
2. **Phase 2.5: End-to-end smoke test** — `sourcerer run --config test-config.yaml --output json` executes Exa search → dedup → JSON output. Pipeline checkpoints work. Run artifacts created. First test with hand-written search config (no intake yet).

### Short-term (next 2-3 sessions)

3. **Phase 3A + 3B in parallel** — Intake Engine (conversation, content research, config generation) + AI Layer (provider abstraction, prompt templates, caching). These can run as parallel agents.
4. **Phase 3C: Integration** — wire intake to AI layer, end-to-end test from `sourcerer intake` through discovery.

### Medium-term

5. **Phase 4: Enrichment adapters** — adapter-x (Twitter), adapter-hunter (email), GitHub hardening, enrichment orchestrator
6. **Phase 5: Scoring engine** — signal extraction, weighted scoring, narrative generation, tiering, re-scoring
7. **Phase 6: Output adapters** — CSV, Notion, CLI results display

### Strategic

- **Run a real client engagement at Phase 2 completion** — use Sourcerer with a hand-written search config for a live sourcing engagement. The feedback is worth more than any spec review.
- **Open-source timing TBD** — options: Phase 2 (early, raw), Phase 4 (functional), Phase 7 (polished)
- **Pricing model needed** — decide per-engagement pricing before Phase 2 ends

## V1 Success Criteria

1. User can `npx sourcerer init`, configure API keys, and run a full pipeline from intake to scored output
2. Intake conversation produces a talent profile + reviewable search config
3. Discovery finds candidates across Exa (+ P0 similarity from success profile seeds)
4. Enrichment fills in GitHub code signals, X/Twitter social, Hunter.io email verification
5. Scoring is fully grounded — every claim traces to an `EvidenceItem`
6. Output pushes to Notion, CSV, JSON, and Markdown
7. Identity resolution correctly deduplicates across multi-source data
8. Reruns upsert (not duplicate) against stable candidate IDs

**Target Metrics:**
- Tier 1 precision: >70% of Tier 1 candidates are human-validated as strong fits
- Dedup accuracy: <5% duplicate rate across multi-source runs
- Cost per run: <$5 for a typical 50-candidate search

## Cross-Surface Notes

- **Repo is private** on GitHub (`matthewod11-stack/sourcerer`). No deployment — CLI tool runs locally.
- **4 git commits** on main: monorepo scaffold (Phase 1.1) + Phase 1 + Phase 2.1-2.3 + PROJECT_STATE.md + GitHub polish (README, MIT license).
- **Build command**: `pnpm build` (Turbo, topological). **Test command**: `pnpm test` (171 tests, all passing).
- **Config file**: `~/.sourcerer/config.yaml` — API keys for Exa, GitHub, AI provider. Created by `sourcerer init`.
- **Run artifacts**: written to `runs/YYYY-MM-DD-<role>/` with `run-meta.json`, checkpoints, candidate data.
- **Predecessor repos**: Lunar Labs and Agoric sourcing repos were custom per-client. Sourcerer is the portable, multi-client evolution.
- **The CLI is the product AND the service infrastructure.** Same tool, different configs. Portability across clients is the core requirement.
- **Phase 3 is the biggest risk** — intake engine, content research, and company intelligence are each independently complex. Watch for 2x estimated sessions.
- **Phase 5 (scoring/grounding) is the hardest technical problem** — LLM grounding constraints are hard to enforce. Early grounding test planned in Phase 3C.
